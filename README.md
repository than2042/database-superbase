# Reflection

- The project was part of the bootcamp designed to reinforce React concepts and Backend server learned during the dedicated full stack.
- One of the challenges I faced involved updating the count when a user clicked the "Buy" button for a specific store. Intially, the cookie count wasn't being updated accordingly; instead, the quantities for all stores were affected. The goal was to ensure that only the count for the selected store was updated.
- Another challenge was to disable the "Buy" button when the cookie count was insufficient to make a purchase from the store. Initially, the disabling mechanism was not function as intended, allowing users to click the 'Buy' button even when the cookie count was less then 20.
- I have improved the game UI and adjused the design approach to transform the Cookie Clicker game into a more engaging and visually appealing user interface.
